# Searching pane contents shows when line was printed

I noticed today while searching backward through a Tmux pane's contents that in the upper right is a timestamp, presumably the time when the line was printed.
Far enough back in a long-running pane that timestamp became a day of the week and day of the month (e.g. `Sat16`).
