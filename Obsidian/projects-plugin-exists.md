# Projects plugin exists

I encountered [this presentation](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/26/productivity/) recently about managing lots of side projects, and one of the tools the presenter makes heavy use of is GitHub Projects.
I wasn't familiar with Projects, so I tinkered with it some, but I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for task management and I've gotten used to having task data locally and available as plain text, which is amenable to scripting.

It occurred to me that there might be an Obsidian plugin to do something like Projects, and I was reminded of the [DB folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder?tab=readme-ov-file) plugin, which I've used for managing a grocery list, but I couldn't get it to work very well for managing tasks on different projects.
Its docs, however, mentioned the [Obsidian Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects?tab=readme-ov-file) plugin.
After a couple quick video tutorials and some experimentation, I think I've found a suitable substitute for GitHub Projects.
