# Move split to new tab with Ctrl-w T

I often work with the quickfix pane and want to see the list in its own tab, rather than as a split at the bottom of the current pane.
[This answer](https://superuser.com/a/118193) taught me that you can do that with `Ctrl-w T`.
(Note that the `T` is capitalized, denoting `Shift-t`.)
