# TILs

I started following [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/) a few days ago, and today he mentioned [Julia Evan's newly-started TILs](https://jvns.ca/til/) and led me to [Josh Branchaud's extensive repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).
I have a vague recollection of hearing about TIL logs before, but I shrugged them off.
Lately, though, I've been trying to catalogue aspects of my workflow and share it more, and keeping a history of TILs seems like the way to go.

I also like the attitude of "Learn in public", or as my wife put it when we were dating in college, "Less mystery, more awesome."
