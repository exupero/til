# Capture hover state in screenshot

On Mac I usually take screenshots by pressing Cmd+Shift+4 then selecting an area.
Today, I took a screenshot of a web UI in a hover state, but Mac OS didn't capture the hover state, and instead showed it as if my cursor wasn't on top of it, presumably because screenshots omit the cursor.

Fortunately, I [learned that Cmd+Shift+5 presents a toolbar](https://www.howtogeek.com/718101/how-to-take-a-screenshot-with-a-visible-mouse-cursor-on-mac/) that provides a "Show Mouse Pointer" option.

It seemed a little hit or miss, but I was eventually able to get a screenshot with the desired hover state, so I'm guessing the misses have more to do with how I'm using it.
