# Espanso expansion still works after form loses and regains focus

Before switching to [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) to expand text snippets, I used [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
Some of my workflows prompted me for information using Alfred's pop-up input, but if I focused another application the input would disappear and I'd have to go back to the text I wanted expanded, delete it, and retype it.
Today I learned that Espanso's forms don't have that problem.
When prompted for some information, I needed to expand another window, but the form remained on the screen, and when I switched back to it and provided the necessary information, the original text snippet was expanded in the application.

One caveat does seem to be that before submitting the form you have to switch back to the application where you want the snippet expanded.
