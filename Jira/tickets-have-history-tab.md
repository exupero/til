# Tickets have "History" tab

I've occasionally wanted to see when the status or some other field on a ticket changed, not just the comments, but the closest I had was email notifications.
Today an urgent ticket changed and I wanted to see who made the change sooner than the email notification arrived.
After searching and only coming up with help that was tangential, out of date, or needlessly complex, Google's AI clued me in:

> open the issue, scroll down to the "Activity" section, and select the "History" option

It's been there all along, but I never noticed.
Glad to know it now.
