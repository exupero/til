# Insert graph into note on iPad

While demonstrating some simple algebraic manipulation in iOS's Notes app on an iPad, I got a pop-up menu with the option to "Insert graph".
Tapping it inserted a graph of the linear equation I had written.
To get the menu again, I tapped on the handwritten equation.
When using a finger instead of an Apple Pencil, the menu shows when I tap the equals sign in the equation.
Additional equations can be shown either in a new graph or added to the most recently created existing graph.
When a graph is selected, it can be pinched and zoomed, as well as panned by dragging two fingers.

Besides linear equations, I was able to graph a simple trigonometry equation, but other than that I haven't exercised how capable the equation parsing is.
