# Backticks inside in-line code

In-line code in Markdown is delimited with backticks (`` ` ``), so to use a backtick in in-line code, [delimit the code with two backticks](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/82722).
That causes some confusion when the backtick is at the beginning or end of the code, so add a space after the opening pair of backticks and a space before the closing pair.
