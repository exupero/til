# Date input exists

I needed a simple widget for selecting a date but didn't want to find a library, so on a whim I checked whether the native `<input />` element supported a type of `date`.
It [does](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)!

By default the styling uses a monospace font, but the pop-up UI for selecting a date is good enough for my purpose.
