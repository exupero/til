# RSS feed of commit activity

I use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) as an RSS reader on my phone, and I wanted to subscribe to [Josh Branchaud's TILs](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), since they include many of my own interests (e.g. Clojure, Git, Tmux).
[This article](https://linuximpact.com/use-github-rss-feeds-to-stay-up-to-date-with-your-favourite-projects/) gave me the URL format to get an RSS feed from a repo's commit activity, namely `https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/commits.atom`.
