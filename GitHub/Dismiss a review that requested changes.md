# Dismiss a review that requested changes

A pull request I was a reviewer for had a merge problem that created a bunch of unnecessary changes.
To prevent the PR from being merged, I reviewed it and requested changes.
Once the problem was fixed I wanted to remove my blocking review, but the only way I've done that before was to approve the PR and the remaining changes weren't ones I was familiar enough with to approve.
Fortunately, you can [dismiss a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/dismissing-a-pull-request-review).
