# Access PostgreSQL docs with `man`

I typically use [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) for quick checks of PostgreSQL documentation, but today I happened across [this comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/512451/how-can-i-add-a-column-that-doesnt-allow-nulls-in-a-postgresql-database#comment54209679_512485) and learned that when Postgres is installed `man` can show Postgres docs.
For example, `man CREATE_TABLE` and `man ALTER_TABLE` both show the grammar of the expected statements.
